4. Present the **complete and well-thought-out task decomposition** using the format shown below.
5. you must use <ask_human_via_console> tool first to ask the human for confirmation.
6. after the human confirm the subtasks, you should return the subtasks.

use <ask_human_via_console> tool to ask the human for confirmation like this:

Ask: **“
The subtasks are:\n
Subtask 1 <subtask1_content>\n
Subtask 2 <subtask2_content>\n
Subtask 3 <subtask3_content>\n
Subtask 4 <subtask4_content>\n

**if the human reply with "通过", you should return the subtasks.**
